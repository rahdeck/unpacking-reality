    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Ooops, there was a gap yesterday in my writing. To my defense I might add that it was a pretty busy day, spent mostly packing up and cleaning the house. I’ve been selling our household appliances through Craigslist recently and have had a few thoughts around it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sell items on a first-come-first-served basis. This avoids late cancellations, etc.</li>
<li>It’s hard to believe in 2016 but there still is no good system for transferring money <em><strong>fast</strong></em> between individuals! Many times when someone wants to buy an item and wants me to hold it for them for a while, I’d like to ask them to give me a security deposit so that they don’t back out in the last minute. Unless they visit me and hand me the money, I don’t know of a good way to do it on a short schedule (on a minute scale, maybe up to a few hours, but definitely not days!). It would be even better if there was an Escrow account like that for additional security and peace of mind for both parties.</li>
<li>If you’re lowering the price because there’s no interest in the item, do it gradually, don’t drop by 50% in one go. Requires time though.</li>
<li>Start selling early. You’ll have more time to gauge the interest in the item, lower the price gradually in steps if it’s initially too high and have time for back-and-forth email exchanges.</li>
<li>Be upfront about the item’s condition, take good pictures, but don’t oversell the item. I’m sure there is a whole science on selling stuff so excuse me if all this seems naive and very basic, but that’s just the lessons I’ve learnt the hard way while selling on CL.</li>
</ol>
