    <div class="article-content">
      <p>The missing entries in the past 3 days were due to our moving between continents and lack of PC to write on. I had to return my work laptop to IT in Japan and will pick up a new one soon here in Australia.</p>
<p>We have arrived today, quite tired after an 9h overnight flight, though not the longest we have been on this year. We will be staying for 30 nights in a serviced apartment with all the amenities such as fully equipped kitchen, laundry room and even access to gym, pool and sauna, which is a great perk. At $200 AUD per night I think that is a reasonable expectation to offer that to guests :-)</p>
<p>Our goodbye to Japan was quite emotional, after all we have lived there for 5 years so we had plenty of time to get attached to people, places and culture.</p>
<p>We gave a bottle of wine to our landlord of 5 years (we never moved within Japan) as a thank-you parting gift and in return received 3 handmade kimono wallets/purses that were made by his wife's mother (so they must be quite old since him and his wife look like they are in their 80s).</p>
<p>We had an Izakaya party with my colleagues from work which was great fun.</p>
<p>We both cried a bit when we were leaving our house in Setagaya-ku, our home of 5 years, with a beautiful little garden with 3 plum trees and many other interesting plants.</p>
<p>I surely hope I'll be back in Japan someday and will have a chance to see this beautiful country again.</p>
