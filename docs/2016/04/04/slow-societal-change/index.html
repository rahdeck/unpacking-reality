      <p>Going with the flow today and writing yet another entry!</p>
<p>Slow change in societies is what’s been on my mind quite often lately. Examples: we’ve had Internet, advanced online security and online systems that can do millions of transactions per minute for 20 years now, yet we’re still going to elections or referendums on our feet. Most people in developed countries have access to Internet so lack of access is not an excuse anymore, and if you really are off the grid, there might always be an option to cast old-style ballots but it should not be the only one, this day and age.</p>
<p>We iterate over the processes and structures (such as governance structures) too slowly, which, while being safe, probably keeps the human race from developing at a faster pace.</p>
<p>We are still living in a world of nation-states which gradually stops making sense (if it ever had one) as the world population grows and the strain we put on the ecosystems gets larger and we realize we’re sharing the same planet and its resources so this cannot keep going on for much longer. Yet not much is being done about it - change is very slow and spearheaded by enterpreneurs such as Elon Musk and not governments.</p>
<p>European Union is an example of a bold political vision to challenge that status quo, though it’s still far from ideal. It seems to me that a lot of political systems and processes that were put into place before the advent of instant global connectivity are now an obstacle to overcoming those looming Earth-scale problems. This needs to change but those very systems were designed so that they value and preserve stability over the pace of change, thus possibly inhibiting progress.</p>
