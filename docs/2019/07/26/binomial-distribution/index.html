<em><strong>Probability of getting exactly <em>k</em> 6's in 10 dice throws</strong></em></p>
<p>Binomial distribution is a very handy tool to calculate probability of getting <em>k</em> successes in <em>n</em> trials.</p>
<p>The canonical example is coin tossing, because it's easy and intuitive to define heads as success and tails as failure, with equal probabilities (0.5) in case of a fair coin.</p>
<p>Another example is dice throws. Here one can be a little more creative with what constitutes success and failure. For example, throwing an even number can be considered a success (probability of a success in a single trial equal to 0.5) or throwing a six (probability of a success in a single trial equal to \(\frac{1}{6}\).</p>
<p>One can get very creative in how one defines success and failure so that this tool can be applied in an endless number of situations. I guess the main difficulty might lie in an appropriate definition of success and calculating its probability in a single trial. Once you've done that, you can apply this formula mechanistically and get the result.</p>
<p>I write this post to etch in my memory how to derive the formula for a probability of getting <em>k</em> successes in <em>n</em> trials. The derivation is actually pretty intuitive so I hope that by writing it down I will remember the derivation process, rather than memorize the formula which is something my brain is not so great at.</p>
<p>Let's work an example and assume we want to know what is the probability of getting two sixes in ten die throws. We have the following information at our disposal:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>n</em> (number of trials) = 10</li>
<li><em>k</em> (number of desired successes) = 2</li>
<li><em>p</em> (probability of success in each trial, assuming a fair dice) =\(\frac{1}{6}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>To visualize the possible outcomes let's treat each sequence of ten throws as a sequence of ten consecutive letters, S or F (for success or failure), in this case limiting the total number of S's in the sequence to two. Here are a few example sequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSFFFFFFFF</li>
<li>SFSFFFFFFF</li>
<li>SFFFFFFFFS</li>
</ul>
<p>Since there are two out of ten positions for S's to be in, there are a total of \(\binom{10}{2}\) (or, equivalently, \(\binom{10}{8}\)) possible sequences with two S's and eight F's.</p>
<p>The probability of each of those sequences occurring is a product of probabilities of all individual events, which we know in this case are \(\frac{1}{6}\) for success and \(1-\frac{1}{6}\) for failure. So for each sequence the probability is: \(\frac{1}{6}^2 \cdot (1-\frac{1}{6})^8\) (exponent of two because we have two successes, exponent of eight because we have eight failures). But as we've established there are \(\binom{10}{2}\) sequences so we have to multiply probability of each sequence by that number to get the final formula: \(\binom{10}{2}\frac{1}{6}^2(1-\frac{1}{6})^8 = 0.29071\)</p>
<p>The generic formula with symbols instead of actual values is thus:</p>
<p>\(\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\)</p>
<p>I hope that derivation makes sense (though I might have taken some shortcuts and made assumptions)Â  and intuitively explains the formula. Actually, now that I look at the formula after I've derived it, it seems not that hard to remember it in its symbolic representation either (but it could be because I've just worked an example and the formula might fade away over time).</p>
<p>The final result can actually be calculated without the formula, purely by combinatorial argument:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are a total of \(6^{10}\) possible outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are a total of \(\binom{10}{2}\) outcomes with exactly two 6's</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are a total of \(5^8\) ways for 8 remaining dices to turn up (we have 5 as the base of exponentiation because we cannot select any additional 6's as we only want two of them)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final result is thus:</p>
<p>\(\frac{\binom{10}{2} \cdot 5^8}{6^{10}} = 0.29071\)</p>
<p>which is the same as calculated above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The probability formula will come in handy when the combinatorial argument is unwieldy or harder to make.</p>
