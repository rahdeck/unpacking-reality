Example of cycling obstacles (link to pedestrian obstacles post):
    - 3 major bridges with no ramps or elevators (or broken elevators):
        - Harbour Bridge
        - Gladesville Bridge (also bikes banned from sidewalk)
        - Pyrmont Bridge (elevator or escalator - both frequently broken)

    - Bikes are not welcome on the roads. That's why in Sydney cyclists need and tend to cycle in groups, to feel a bit stronger against the assaults of the drivers
    - When cycling on Sydney streets I've personally been sworn at, thrown things at, honked at on multiple occasions.
