Give examples from press/online articles/books where authors give advice
as if correlation is definitely causation:  
  
1. Find the article where they found a correlation between being able to
stand up on one leg with one's eyes closed and lower risk of accident in
your old age and then went on to recommend practicing standing on one
leg as if improving your balance will prevent the accidents.
