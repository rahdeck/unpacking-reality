Moving across continents, that is.

Things are getting hectic with the upcoming move to Australia. I feel like I’m not entirely in control of what’s going on and a bit stressed by the amount of things to juggle concurrently.

Moving across countries and/or continents has so far always been a stressful affair to me, not matter how well organized it is. It’s just the nature of change and unpredictability that puts me into this slight unease, must be something about my personality. I do enjoy the outcome and value very much the ability to move but the moving process is just a lot to handle at one time. Once we move the stress will gradually fade to previous levels, I’m sure, but the intermediate spike is not a great feeling.

On a positive note, it does give me insight into what stresses me out and how I react to it. I hope to get a bit more into an observer role state of mind rather than feel like a helpless participant of the inevitable events.
