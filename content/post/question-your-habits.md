So it’s the next beautiful morning here in Tokyo.

I’ve been doing a fair amount of reading on Elon Musk and his businesses and ideas, pretty inspiring stuff. Though I don’t think I’m very entrepreneurial myself this still managed to light up some fire inside me and make me think of all the great things out there to be done and question a lot of existing practices, businesses, processes, etc. Funny how people get stuck in a rut and fail to see outside the box.

After reading this material I’ve started looking at some of my habits and routines and questioning their values. Even if I don’t change them, it should be somewhat educational to do this occasionally, even if only to reinforce existing habits (if there’s a good reason to).

For example, I thought about our own carbon footprint. We don’t have a car and use bikes for most trips, with occasional usage of the train for longer trips and of course airplanes for overseas travel. It’s hard to think of alternative ways to travel with a lower carbon footprint and the same convenience. What we can do instead is curb our flying a bit and contribute to environment in this way.

Ok, time’s up, not much original content today but definitely more words than previous entries.
