Haven’t had much time to do any sort of introspection on the latest events.

Today has been seriously busy, I spent at least 3 hours on various calls (work related and outside work) and talked to a lot of people. Also visited the local ward office to notify them of us leaving Japan. So I’ve got a lot done i.e. I ticked off a lot of boxes but those were mostly quite menial tasks. I’m not very fond of days like this, when things go by very quickly and I have no time to introspect or think over what I’ve accomplished during that day or work on any self-development. I do understand this is the reality of the accelerating rate of events just before we get on the plane to Australia.

The few left days we have in Japan might be even more intense. Weekend though is ours to enjoy, after all it’s the last weekend we have left in this beautiful country!
