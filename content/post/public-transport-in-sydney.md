My position on the public transport is that if your city/state/country is not adequately providing it then they're not doing their job. If you have to resort to using a car, they're not doing their job. It's not my job to drive nor should it, in fact, be a job expected of any of us, except professional drivers.

Yet, this is a de-facto standard here in Australia. You are expected to be a driver, whether you like it or not, which sucks. You are expected to spend a very considerable portion of your post-tax income (car ownership costs range from [7,000 to 18,000 AUD per year](https://www.savings.com.au/car-loans/ongoing-car-costs), if you can believe it), your time and attention, risk your health and life on something that has been solved by public transport for many decades.

I imagine that in a few decades or perhaps centuries, people will look back on our collective car obssession of the 20th and 21st century with disbelief. They will have a hard time comprehending that we had to drive ourselves around for basic mobility, most of us even every day, to work! So barbaric! What a waste of human time, health and energy that could have been spent on much more than turning a wheel and pressing pedals and occassionally losing your life in the process.

Some countries or cities seem to understand it and made public transport great. The tax I paid both in absolute and relative numbers (around 30%) was about the same in both Japan and Australia. However, I felt this money was very well spent on useful things in Tokyo and I don't feel the same way about Sydney. In Tokyo I benefitted from very high quality public transport and other public services, which are much lower quality in Sydney.

What is that tax money spent on in Sydney? I don't know but I suspect a lot of it is spent on building WestConnex (a highway mega-project that is estimated to cost, as per Wikipedia: "at least $20 billion and possibly more than $45 billion"). This means every inhabitant of Sydney (there are around 5 million people in Sydney) has paid from $4,000 to almost $10,000 AUD for it. If we exclude people that don't pay tax, this figure will probably double! Crazy amount of money to pay for 33km of highway!

Interestingly, even though the road infrastructure gets so much investment, it is much worse in Sydney than in Tokyo. The roads in Tokyo were "billiard-table" smooth, with absolutely no potholes and there was a very dense street grid throughout the whole city. In Sydney, the surface quality is not terrible, but potholes and uneven surfaces are definitely pretty common, and the street grid is much less dense. I estimated it at 50% of Tokyo's density in one of my [earlier observations]().
