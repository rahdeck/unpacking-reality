Writing a personal journal (or a blog) has been on my mind for a few years but I haven’t had enough motivation to do it with any sort of regularity. I wrote a blog before but it had only a couple of entries in total. A personal journal might be easier to write than a public blog because I don’t need to think about anything that might concern external readers: this is only for me to see whether I can discover any interesting insights about myself. It may grow into something for external readers, though right now it has no purpose other than my own introspection.
