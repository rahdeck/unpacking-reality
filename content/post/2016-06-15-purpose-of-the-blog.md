Some of the things I hope to get out of writing this are:

- Measure how many words I can produce in 5 minutes. See how this changes the longer I write the journal
- Improve the clarity of my writing while maintaining the output volume
- Learn English better
- Build discipline that will transfer to other areas of my life

Right now I’m struggling with the small output volume as 5 minutes does not seem like enough time to write anything substantial. Might be worth to jot down a few ideas over the course of the day and then simply expand them in writing in the journal so the idea generating phase is naturally spread over the day as the ideas occur and I don’t have to scramble for them when sitting down to write the journal.
