It's been almost a year since my last post! I haven't stayed idle
throughout this time. I managed to:  

-   quit my job of 13 years
-   pick up beach volleyball
-   play bridge more regularly

Most importantly, I have created a [new
website](https://rahdeck.github.io/) where I publish solutions to
problems from a book called "Applied Combinatorics 2nd Edition" by Barry
Tesman and Fred Roberts ([available on
Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Combinatorics-Fred-Roberts/dp/1420099825/))  
  
I recommend the book if you enjoy combinatorics at all! It has plenty of
real-life problems and you don't need much background in mathematics to
learn the material.
